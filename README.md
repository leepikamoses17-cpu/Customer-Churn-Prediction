# Customer-Churn-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using Machine Learning techniques. The project follows a complete end-to-end ML workflow including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and model saving.
A machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn based on behavior and service usage data from a telecom company. This project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model tuning, and evaluation using Python and Scikit-learn.

## Project Objective
The goal is to build a binary classification model that predicts whether a customer will churn (Yes or No). Churn prediction helps businesses reduce customer loss and improve retention strategies.

## Dataset Info
Source: IBM Telco Customer Churn Dataset
Rows: ~7,000 customers
Target: Churn column (Yes = churned, No = not churned)
Features: Gender, Contract type, Monthly charges, Tenure, etc.

## Results
Achieved a high AUC-ROC score showing good distinction between churned and retained customers.
Feature importance highlighted key factors like contract type, tenure, and monthly charges.
